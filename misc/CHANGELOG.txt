v8.1.5.2:
	SPOILERS:
		- Added a Feedback section to the Overview so you can let me know how great the addon is... or how terrible... it's a perspective thing.
		- Added a Commands section to the Overview so you have a reference for what to put in the chat box to do the things. You're welcome!
		- LastSeen now has Custom Item support! Now you can rep your collection of Bright Eyeballs and Broad Claymores.
		- The Search feature now exists because it should.
		- New and updated records are now clickable references. Now you can shift-click items into Guild chat and brag about your PHAT loots! 
	
	I'M OK NOW:
		- Looting Uncommon+ crafted items or pushed loot (e.g. world quests) no longer vanishes before your eyes. You can now make it rain right into LastSeen's database with even more items!
		- When using the dump command you no longer need to fear the two lines per item spam... just the fact that it still dumps the entire database to your chat; will fix soon!
		- Spiced up the search command output with a bit of simplicity.
		
	ONE REMINDER:
		- Don't even think about leaving an extremely attractive comment in the comment section below. ;)
